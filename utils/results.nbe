results|bobxp|bobxp|general/tcp|21156|Security Hole|"MaximumPasswordAge": [FAILED]\n\nTitle - Maximum Password Age\nDescription - This forces users to change their passwords regularly. The lower this value is set, the more likely users will be to choose poor passwords that are easier for them to remember (e.g., Mypasswd1, Mypasswd2, Mypasswd3). The higher this value is set, the more likely the password will be compromised and used by unauthorized parties.\n\nThe following AND condition has failed:\n{\n MaximumPasswordAge:\n Remote value: 225\n Policy value: [0..60]\n}\n\n
results|bobxp|bobxp|general/tcp|21156|Security Hole|"MinimumPasswordAge": [FAILED]\n\nTitle - Minimum Password Age\nDescription - This setting requires users to wait for a certain number of days before changing their password again. The setting prevents a user from changing a password when it reaches the maximum age and then immediately changing it back to the previous password. Unfortunately, this setting also prevents users who inadvertently reveal a new password to others from changing it immediately without administrator intervention.\n\nRemote value: 0\nPolicy value: [1..4294967295]\n\n
results|bobxp|bobxp|general/tcp|21156|Security Hole|"MinimumPasswordLength": [FAILED]\n\nTitle - Minimum Password Length\nDescription - This setting specifies the minimum length of a password in characters. The rationale behind this setting is that longer passwords are more difficult to guess and crack than shorter passwords. The downside is that longer passwords are often more difficult for users to remember. Organizations that want to set a relatively large minimum password length should encourage their users to use passphrases, which may be easier to remember than conventional passwords.\n\nRemote value: 8\nPolicy value: [12..4294967295]\n\n
results|bobxp|bobxp|general/tcp|21156|Security Note|"PasswordComplexity": [PASSED]\n\nTitle - Passwords Must Meet Complexity Requirements\nDescription - Like the Minimum Password Length setting, this setting makes it more difficult to guess or crack passwords. Enabling this setting implements complexity requirements including not having the user account name in the password and using a mixture of character types, including upper case and lower case letters, digits, and special characters such as punctuation marks.\n\n
results|bobxp|bobxp|general/tcp|21156|Security Note|"PasswordHistoryEnforcement": [PASSED]\n\nTitle - Enforce Password History\nDescription - This setting determines how many old passwords the system will remember for each account. Users will be prevented from reusing any of the old passwords. For example, if this is set to 24, then the system will not allow users to reuse any of their last 24 passwords. Old passwords may have been compromised, or an attacker may have taken a long time to crack encrypted passwords. Reusing an old password could inadvertently give attackers access to the system.\n\n
results|bobxp|bobxp|general/tcp|21156|Security Note|"AccountLockoutDuration": [PASSED]\n\nTitle - Account Lockout Duration\nDescription - This value specifies how long the user account should be locked out. This is often set to a low but substantial value (e.g., 15 minutes), for two reasons. First, a legitimate user that is accidentally locked out only has to wait 15 minutes to regain access, instead of asking an administrator to unlock the account. Second, an attacker who is guessing passwords using brute force methods will only be able to try a small number of passwords at a time, then wait 15 minutes before trying any more. This greatly reduces the chances that the brute force attack will be successful.\n\n
results|bobxp|bobxp|general/tcp|21156|Security Note|"AccountLockoutThreshold": [PASSED]\n\nTitle - Account Lockout Threshold\nDescription - The threshold value specifies the maximum number of failed attempts that can occur before the account is locked out.\n\n
results|bobxp|bobxp|general/tcp|21156|Security Note|"AccountLockoutReset": [PASSED]\n\nTitle - Reset Account Lockout Counter After\nDescription - This specifies the time period to be used with the lockout threshold value. For example, if the threshold is set to 10 attempts and the duration is set to 15 minutes, then if more than 10 failed login attempts occur with a single user account within a 15-minute period, the account will be disabled.\n\n

Auditing of success or failure of system wide object access will create numerous log entries. Certain object access failures may be normal as a result of applications requesting all access types to objects, even though the application does not require all access types to function properly.

The smaller size should allow sufficient audit information for supporting the investigation of suspicious events, but since it is overwritten, does not require administrator interaction for clearing the file. Microsoft recommends that the combined size of all the event logs (including DNS logs, Directory Services logs, and Replication logs on Servers or Domain Controllers) should not exceed 300 megabytes. Exceeding the recommended value can impact performance.\n\n
